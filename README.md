## ðŸ§© Component Architecture & Rules

- All **shared components** must be placed in:

  - `src/components/[category]/ComponentName.tsx`

- If a component is used across multiple pages, place it in:

  - `src/components/ui/` or appropriate subfolder (`layout/`, `events/`, etc.)

- Every component file must use **named export syntax**:

  ```tsx
  export const ComponentName = () => {
    return <div>...</div>;
  };
  ```

### ðŸ“¦ Import Rules

1. **Component is first imported into its local index.ts inside its folder:**

   ```ts
   // src/components/ui/index.ts
   export * from "./Button";
   ```

2. **Then it's re-exported from the main components/index.ts:**

   ```ts
   // src/components/index.ts
   export * from "./ui";
   export * from "./layout";
   export * from "./events";
   ```

3. **Finally, import and use it anywhere:**

   ```tsx
   import { Button } from "@/components";
   ```

   Follow the same structure used in the Hero and Home components.

- Keep code minimal and consistent.
- Use DaisyUI utility classes like:
  - `btn`
  - `btn-primary`
  - `btn-outline`
- Avoid custom `bg-`, `text-`, or `hover:` classes unless necessary.
